Orange2 goal-oriented learning add-on                                            
======================                                                           
                                                                                 
This is an add-on for the old version of Orange (Orange2). The add-on contains    
implementations of several algorithms for goal-oriented conceptualization.       

Installation                                                                     
------------                                                                     

Linux:
1. Clone [Orange2 source]{https://github.com/biolab/orange}.
2. Compile Orange2.
3. Clone this repository in the source folder of Orange2.
4. Run make.  

For Windows users I suggest Visual Studio. Before compiling you will
additionally need to run \_pyextract.bat, which prepares all necessary includes.
